# Word Connect Game

Welcome to the **Word Connect Game**! This is a fun and interactive game where players need to connect related words based on groups. The game is designed to test your ability to link words that belong together, whether it's countries and their capitals, animals, foods, or more.

## How to Play

The game presents a grid of words, and your task is to click on words that are related to each other. The words are grouped into sets (e.g., a country and its capital, or a group of fruits). Once you successfully connect a group of words (2, 3, or 4 words), they will disappear from the grid. The goal is to match all the words before running out of attempts!

### Objective

- Select and connect words that belong to the same group (e.g., country and capital, or types of fruits).
- Each group has a specific number of words to connect (2, 3, or 4).
- Track your attempts and aim to match the words with the least number of attempts.
